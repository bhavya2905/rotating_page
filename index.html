India is a successful example of a nation-state, that shows that it is perfectly possible to have a strong nation-state without having to homogenize different community identities into a standard type and accepting individuality.There must be some problems or limitations to the diversity of this country related to communism, casteism, religion etc. But, despite of all the challenges India has done fairly well compared to most of the other nations of the world. India has survived not only as a nation but as a strong nation-state.</p>
